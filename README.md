## About Me 💻

I'm a full-stack developer with a strong passion for TypeScript 🚀, web development 🌐, and exploring both front-end and back-end technologies. I'm constantly exploring new frameworks and libraries to improve my skills. 💪

On the front-end, I'm proficient in building responsive and accessible user interfaces using modern frameworks like React ⚛️ , Next , Remix , Server-Components. I have experience with CSS preprocessors like Sass 💎 and styling solutions like styled-components and CSS modules. 🎨

When it comes to the back-end, I'm skilled in designing and implementing RESTful APIs using Node.js , Nest.js , Express 🔰 , as well as working with databases like MongoDB , PostgreSQL and MySql. 🗃️ I'm also familiar with server-side rendering techniques and have experience with popular back-end frameworks like Nest.js and Fastify. ⚡

I'm always eager to learn and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in the ever-evolving world of web development. 📚 Feel free to explore my repositories to see some of my projects and contributions. 🚀
